# Meteora
 
A Python script to collect Canadian weather station data from a Statistics Canada API.

## Usage

Download the repository and install the required Python modules. Edit the config.ini file to point to your SQL Server (with Windows built-in authentication). Modify the CSV file *data/Station Inventory EN.csv* for the subset of stations and years you are interested in, then run the script. The complete set of weather station data is very large, proceed with caution.
